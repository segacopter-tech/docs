The new full-screen geometry dash made with GitHub pages is available [here](https://segacopter-tech.github.io/Geometry/)

This is the same as the old geometry dash just full screen. An advantage is you dont have to CLICK on the geometry dash game. But a DOWNSIDE is that this one is blocked sometimes.
