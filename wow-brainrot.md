##### a newsdoc by graham terpstra


back in the olden days, we did NOT have computers and i mean NOT AT ALL
but now. we have not just them, but iPads and smartphones!
now these things are awesome and all for this generation.
but it has started to get like where the grown ups will start taking them away for no reason.
but something even better is brianrot because we can use it these days and no one can understand us!
and that makes people say: WOW! Brainrot!
